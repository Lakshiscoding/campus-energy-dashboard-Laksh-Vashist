# Campus Energy-Use Dashboard

Capstone Project for Energy Consumption Analysis.

## Project Overview

This tool reads energy meter data from CSV files, processes it, and generates visual dashboards to help campus administration track electricity usage.

## Folder Structure

`data/`: Contains raw CSV files (e.g., building_A.csv).
`output/`: Stores the generated dashboard image and summary reports.
`main.py`: The main script handling ingestion, analysis, and visualization.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas matplotlib`
2. Run the script: `python main.py`
3. Check the `output/` folder for results.
